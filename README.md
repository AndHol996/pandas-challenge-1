# WholeSale Data Analysis 
***
## Description
This is a program for analyzing client data from a wholesale distributor. It returns a DataFrame of the total profits, costs, shipping costs, revenue and units sold to the top 5 clients as well as intermediate analysis of the data in the CSV file. This program shows the use of pandas, use of a kernel in a jupyter notebook, and transforming and analyzing data from CSV files.

## Project Status
The code is at a stable state. May revise the code in order to improve understanding of working with pandas and CSV files.

## Conditions
The only specification of for this program is that it is running on Python 3.10.14 for a Conda environment, kernel, and imported pandas.
